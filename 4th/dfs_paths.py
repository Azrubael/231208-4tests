"""
In this example, the dfs_paths function uses a recursive approach to traverse the tree in a depth-first manner and generate a list of all possible paths. Each path is divided by the item "END". The algorithm starts at the root node and explores all paths in the tree, appending nodes to the current path and backtracking when necessary.

When you run the provided code, it will output a list of all possible paths in the tree, with each path divided by "END".
