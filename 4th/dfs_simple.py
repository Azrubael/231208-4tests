# An example algorithm for "deep first search" (DFS) in Python 3, considering a tree with more than two branches on some nodes:

"""
This algorithm uses a recursive approach to traverse the tree in a depth-first manner. It starts at the root node and visits each node in the tree, processing the current node and then recursively calling the DFS function on each child node. In this example, the algorithm prints the value of each node as it visits them.

This is just one possible implementation of the DFS algorithm in Python 3, and there are other variations depending on the specific requirements of your use case.
